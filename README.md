# Object-Oriented Programming in C and C++

## Description

This repository contains a collection of practical assignments (TPs) completed as part of university courses focused on object-oriented programming using **C** and **C++**.
Each folder corresponds to a specific TP, demonstrating the progression from structured programming in C to object-oriented concepts and data structures in C++.

## Structure

```
/
├── TP1/        # Introduction to C programming
├── TP2-3/      # Classes and dynamic memory allocation
├── TP4-5/      # Composition and linked lists
├── .gitignore  # To ignore certain file extensions on GitHub (e.g., .exe)
└── README.md
```

## Versions

* **Language:** C / C++
* **Compiler:** GCC / G++
* **Minimum Version:** C99 (for C) and C++11 (for C++)

## Execution

To compile and run each TP, navigate to the corresponding folder and use:

### For C programs

```bash
gcc main.c -o main
./main
```

### For C++ programs

```bash
g++ main.cpp -o main
./main
```

You may adapt the filenames depending on the structure of each TP.
